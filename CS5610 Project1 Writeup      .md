○  What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or
challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?

* 	For me, the most challenging part is the responsive design. I searched for some online resources about how to change the behavior of the navbar when the screen shrinks, many of solutions involve javascript, so finally I have to come up with the design on my own.

* Working with HTML and CSS is not easy for me, I met lots of confusing details and weird behaviours, and some of them are tricky to debuf, I think the overall designing and coding took about 8-10 hours.

○ What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

* As I mentioned, since I know I cannot use javascript to hide the navbar under an icon for user to click on, I simply changing the navbar from horizontal to vertical. It is simple and naive, but it works. For other parts, like image boxes and text boxes, I adopted the same approach, also I adjusted the proportion and margin/padding to make the page look natural on mobile devices.

○ What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?

* Firstly I designed the logic of navbar, how it should change in different pages to indicate which page we are currently at, and how to go back to the homepage (by clicking the name). 
* Then, I spent some time exploring the font style and background color, I tried several things and finally found something looks good for me.
* Also, I explored using Flex v.s. Grid display. I tried both in different pages, and I think for these simple web pages, flex is easier to work with.

Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?

* The overall color and font style is something I am happy with. Also, I am satisfied the hovering effect on the navbar.

○ Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your
site in the future?

* More details for my projects.
* Right now the "About me" page is empty because I don't have any blogs or professional articles to share. So in the future hopefully I can try to fill that empty space.
* As I gained more knowledge in JS, I will consider adding some Javascript feature to make the website more dynamic and prettier.
